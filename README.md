# Equity Valuation
This project looks into the study of Equity Valuation and the many methods as proposed by Dr. Aswath Damodaran of NYU, through his online MBA sessions. To further the application of the study, we attempt it in an excel file for one focal company, and further attempt to extrapolate [WIP] it to an industry in a country.

## Objectives
- Conduct a study of Equity Valuation methodology as put forth by Dr. Aswath Damodaran
- Create a valuation report on a focal company
- [WIP] Attempt to automate this process using open source data in the form of an algorithmic low frequency trader
